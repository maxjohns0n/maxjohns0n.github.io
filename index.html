                Micro-timing is an essential part of human music-making, yet it is absent from most computer music
                systems. Partly to address this gap, we present a novel system for generating music with style-specific
                micro-timing within the <a href="https://sonic-pi.net/">Sonic Pi</a> live coding language. We use a
                probabilistic approach to control the exact timing according to patterns discovered in new analyses of
                existing micro-timing data (jembe drumming and Viennese waltz). This implementation also required the
                introduction of musical metre into Sonic Pi. The new metre and micro-timing systems are inherently
                flexible, and thus open to a wide range of creative possibilities including (but not limited to):
                creating new micro-timing profiles for additional styles; expanded definitions of metre; and the free
                mixing of one micro-timing style with the musical content of another. The code is freely available as a
                <a href="https://rubygems.org/gems/sonicpi-metre">Sonic Pi plug-in</a> and released open source on <a
                    href="https://github.com/MaxTheComputerer/sonicpi-metre">GitHub</a>.

                This project uses two different styles of music as contrasting case studies for evaluation: jembe (or
                “djembe”) drum music from Mali and Viennese waltz music. These two styles both have robust, well-known
                micro-timing characteristics.
